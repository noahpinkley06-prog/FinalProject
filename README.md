Users give a article title, and the program connects to Wikipedia, collect the json data and formats the data so you can see who did it and when. This tool is useful for educational purposes to check the edit history of Wikipedia pages.

How to Run

Run the program.  

When it asks, type a Wikipedia article title and press Enter.  

It will show the last 4 edits to that article.
